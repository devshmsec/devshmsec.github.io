![Anthem Banner](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/anthem.png)

### Description

Anthem is beginner level windows room by Chevalier.This room offers lot of oshint challenges and basic enumeration once we get on the box.As mentioned that this room is easy and very begineer friendly but some questions take lot of time to complete because hints are very confusing and directs you to totally different direction.Before doing this room, you have to know how to use nmap, what is robots.txt file, and how to connect to rdp service using rdp client.

## Task 1

### Nmap Scan

```nmap
nmap -sC -sV -Av -oN nmap/anthem 10.10.139.243
```

-sC - _run all the default scripts_  
-sV - _find the version of all the service running on the target_  
-A  - _run the scan in aggressive mode_  
-v  - _show output in verbose mode_  
-oN - _output to a file in nmap format_   

#### Output

```nmap
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Sun May 17 19:47:35 2020 as: nmap -sC -sV -Av -oA nmap/anthem 10.10.139.243

```

We get lot of information about the target from the above scan.Such as which service is running on which port.It also tells us about the domain name of the target. And it also finds that there is robots.txt file on the website.

| robots.txt file is for the web crawlers to tell them not to scrap for the specific paths or directories on the website.

### Web Analysis

The website is blogging website which has 2 blog posts.

![Home Page](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/home_page.png)

first lets visit the /robots.txt file that we found on the nmap scan.

![Robots](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/robots.png)

looks like we found a text which looks like a possible password for something, that is not found by the nmap scan.Nmap scan show us the four directories, lets try to go to the /umbraco one.

![Umbraco](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/umbraco.png)

It looks like the login page for some kind a CMS for posting content to the webpage we found in homepage.But we don't have the credential to log in.So we must look it after we find the credentials.

Lets try to find Potential user for this CMS login. If you look at the second blog post on the website, Its a poem about admin of the site.

![Blog post 2](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/blog2.png)

If you check the hints it says search on your favourite search engine, So lets just copy the whole poem and search it on the google (my favourite search engine) and we get the name of admin.

![Admin Name](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/admin_name.png)

But the login page demands for email of the user.So lets find the email addres of the admin.If you check on the hints then it says there is an another email on the website which follows the pattern of admin's email.And if you look at the first blog post on the website, it has email address of the author of the post which has the pattern of __intials of user's name__ @ __domain name of the site__.

![Blog post 1](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/blog1.png)

By following the above pattern we should get the email address of the admin.To check that you can try to log in on the CMS with that email address and password we found on the /robots.txt file.

## Task 2

In task 2 we have to find all the flags that are hidden on the website.Actually if you look on the page source of each link that has reference on the website, you will find all the flags.The question and flag doesn't have a connection to each other so you have to try to submit flags for all question and which one accepts it thats the correct question for that flag.

### Flag 1

![Flag 1](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/flag1.png)

### Flag 2

![Flag 2](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/flag2.png)

### Flag 3

![Flag 3](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/flag3.png)

### Flag 4

![Flag 4](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/flag4.png)

## Task 3

On the task 3, we have to connect to the rdp service (Microsoft Terminal Service) that is running on the target machine by the credential we already found on the task 1. But the question says that the box is not on the domain so exclude the domain name from the username.

### User Flag

Once we get on the box, we got the user.txt on the desktop of the user.

![User Flag](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/user_flag.png)


### Administrator's Password

For getting the administrator privledge we have to find the administrator's password.If check on hints it says it is hidden.So we have to enable the hidden option on the file explorer to find it.After doing that we found a backup folder on the C: drive which contains a restore file, if we try to open, we get permission denied.

![Permission Denied](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/permission_denied.png)

So we have to add our user group to the file's property and grant all the permission over the file.

![Add User group](/assets/images/tryhackme/anthem/add_user_group.png)

Now, we get to open the file to read it.And we got the administrator's password.

### Root Flag

Open the CMD with administrator's privledge get the root.txt on the desktop of the administrator.
