# HackTheBox Sauna Walkthrough

![Sauna Banner](/assets/images/hackthebox/sauna/banner.png)

### Synopsis

Sauna is an easy difficulty Windows machine created by egotisticalSW.This machine features active directory enumeration and exploitation.Possible usernames can be derived from the about page of the website for performing ASREPRoasting attack by the GetNPUsers.py from impacket which gives the hash for account which doesn't require kerberos pre-authentication.After we crack the hash we use evil-winrm to get on the box and get the user flag.By running the winPEAS.exe we get the creds for svc_loanmgr which is configured to auto login.After we get on the box as svc_loanmgr we run SharpHound.exe to get the data for bloodhound which tells that svc_loanmgr has DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All extended right which allows to dump the hash from the domain controller by performing DC-Sync attack.After performing the attack we get tha hash for administrator account and get the root flag.

## Reconnaissance

### Nmap Scan

```nmap
nmap -sC -sV -Av -oA nmap/sauna 10.10.10.175
```

-sC - _run all the default scripts_  
-sV - _find the version of all the service running on the target_  
-A  - _run the scan in aggressive mode_  
-v  - _show output in verbose mode_  
-oA - _output to a file in all format_  

```nmap
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Thu Jun 11 17:16:00 2020 as: nmap -sC -sV -Av -oA nmap/sauna 10.10.10.175

### ldapsearch

Search the base for naming context to get the DC (Domain Component)

![ldap DC](/assets/images/hackthebox/sauna/ldap-naming.png)

There is nothing important found on searching the whole base from toplevel.

### Web

If we go to the website, its website for bank and there is a form for email subscription which does nothing.
If we run gobuster on the main page if doesn't found anything useful.

![home page](/assets/images/hackthebox/sauna/home.png)

So there is only thing important in the whole website, usernames on the about page.
get all the usernames and modified with the first letter of the first name and the last name into a file for bruteforcing beacuse thats the format windows uses generally.

![about page](/assets/images/hackthebox/sauna/about.png)

## Foothold

### ASREPRoasting Attack

We have list of possible usernames to bruteforce for checking if kerberos pre-authentication has been disabled for any aof the user.

```usernames
fsmith
scoins
btaylor
skerb
hbear
sdriver
```

Kerberos pre-authentication is a security feature which provides protection against password guessing attacks.If this feature is enabled and pre-authentication is not enforced, we can send dummy request for authentication and get the NTLM encrypted hash from the TGT(Ticket Granting Ticket).This is called ASREPRoasting attack, we can use impacket script for this attack called GetNPUser.py.

Pass the hash to hashcat with mode 18200 and rockyou.txt wordlist for cracking.

### User flag

Connect to the box with evil-winrm by passing the found creds.

![Evil-Winrm](/assets/images/hackthebox/sauna/evil-winrm.png)

After we get on the box we can get the user flag from the fsmith's desktop.

![Evil-Winrm](/assets/images/hackthebox/sauna/user-flag.png)

## Privilege Escalation

### WinPEAS

upload the winPEAS.exe executable to the box and run it.We found that there is another user who is configured for auto login.
And winPEAS found the credential for us.

![svc creds](/assets/images/hackthebox/sauna/svc-creds.png)

login to the box with svc_loanmgr's creds.

![svc login](/assets/images/hackthebox/sauna/svc_login.png)

### Bloodhound

Upload the SharpHound.exe to the box and run the executable download the zip file that it generates, pass it to the bloodhound.
Mark the fsmith and svc_loanmgr user as owned.And make query for **Find Principal with DCSync Rights**.We get the node svc_loanmgr@EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL is connected with the EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL node, via **GetChangesAll** edge.

After clicking for help on the edge we get that svc_loanmgr is capable of dumping password hashes from the domain controller by using DCSync attack.

### DC-Sync Attack

We can use imapcket script called secretsdump.py to perform this attack.

![DC-Sync](/assets/images/hackthebox/sauna/dcsync.png)

### Root flag

Get on the box with dumped hash for administrator by using evil-winrm and get the root flag from Administrator's Desktop.
